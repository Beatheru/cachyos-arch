# Speakers silent on Realtek RT721 + RT1320 SoundWire laptops (e.g. Razer Blade 16 RZ09-0581).
# alsa-ucm-conf 1.2.16.x includes codecs/rt721+rt1320/init.conf, which it doesn't ship, so the
# whole UCM config fails and PipeWire falls back to a stereo profile that never enables the amp.
# rt721 init already comes via the headset codec and rt1320 via sof-soundwire/rt721+rt1320.conf,
# so an empty file is enough. Upstream fixed it in alsa-ucm-conf ba372ade3434 (issue #851); that
# fix drops sof-soundwire/rt721+rt1320.conf, so delete once it no longer exists.
